I am a Postdoc at the n Information Engineer at the Labortory of Signal and Systems of the Federal University of ABC.
In the moment, I am most interested in using Machine Learning (ML) to improve wireless communications systems.
The ideia is to use ML in problems where ML can really bring adavantages and where traditional techniques result in poor performances.
