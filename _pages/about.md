I am a Postdoc at the Laboratory of Signal and Systems of the Federal University of ABC, Brazil.
At the moment, I am most interested in using Machine Learning (ML) to improve wireless communications systems.
The idea is to use ML in problems where it can bring advantages, where traditional techniques are not efficient.
